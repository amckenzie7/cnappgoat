# CNAPPgoat

</div>

CNAPPgoat is a multi-cloud, vulnerable-by-design environment deployment tool â€“ specifically engineered to facilitate
practice arenas for defenders and pentesters. Its main function is to deploy intentionally
vulnerable environments across multiple cloud service providers, to help you sharpen your skills in exploiting,
detecting, and preventing such vulnerabilities.

> **Warning**: CNAPPgoat deploys vulnerable environments. Only use it within safe, controlled sandboxes.

## Getting Started

CNAPPgoat operates as a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool, capable of deploying vulnerable environments to a multitude
of cloud service providers. Built with Go and utilizing Pulumi and the Pulumi automation API, it ensures seamless
environment deployment. One of its unique features is its modular design, which allows for effortless extension to
support an array of cloud service providers and new vulnerable environments. As of now, CNAPPgoat supports AWS, Azure,
and GCP.

### Prerequisites for running CNAPPgoat

- [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/)
- Cloud SDKs for the cloud provider you are using:
    - [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)
    - [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
    - [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

Pulumi dependencies and plugins will install in an on-demand basis according to each scenario's requirements
when you provision your first environment. This means the first time provisioning might take a little longer than
subsequent
ones.

### Installation

#### Downloading the release

1. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/ermetic-research/CNAPPgoat/releases/latest).

   ```bash
   tar -xvf cnappgoat-<version>.tar.gz
   cd cnappgoat-<version>
   ```

2. (Optional) If you'd like to add the extracted binary to your system's PATH (you don't have to, you can just run it
   from the local directory as `./cnappgoat`):

**Option A: Move to a directory in your PATH (e.g., `/usr/local/bin` for macOS and Linux)**

   ```bash
   mv cnappgoat /usr/local/bin/
   ```

**Option B: Add the directory containing the binary to your PATH**

For bash:

   ```bash
   echo 'export PATH=$PATH:<path_to_directory_containing_cnappgoat>' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

For zsh:

   ```bash
   echo 'export PATH=$PATH:<path_to_directory_containing_cnappgoat>' >> ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

Replace `<path_to_directory_containing_cnappgoat>` with the absolute path to the directory where `cnappgoat` binary
resides.

#### Installation using Homebrew

For macOS users, CNAPPgoat can be easily installed using the Homebrew package manager. If you haven't already installed
Homebrew, you can do so by following the instructions on the [official website](https://brew.sh/).

Once Homebrew is set up, you can install CNAPPgoat with the following commands:

```bash
brew tap ermetic-research/cnappgoat
brew install cnappgoat
```

| `list`            | Lists all available scenarios for provisioning.                                                                      | `cnappgoat list`                      |
| `describe`        | Provides detailed information about the specified scenario.                                                          | `cnappgoat describe <scenario name>`  |
| `provision`       | Provisions the scenario specified by the scenario name. To provision all scenarios, simply use `cnappgoat provision` | `cnappgoat provision <scenario name>` |
| `destroy`         | Destroys the scenario specified by the scenario name. To destroy all scenarios, simply use `cnappgoat destroy`       | `cnappgoat destroy <scenario name>`   |

You may use multiple arguments separated by spaces. For example:

```bash
cnappgoat provision <scenario-1> <scenario-2> <scenario-N>
```

#### Flags:

- `--module` - Filters scenarios by module (e.g. CSPM, CIEM, CWPP, etc.)
- `--platform` - Filters scenarios by platform (e.g. AWS, Azure, GCP)
- `--force` - Enables force mode (unlock locked stacks with pulumi cancel)
- `--debug` - Enables debug logging.

These flags are command flags and should be placed after the command. For example:

```bash
cnappgoat provision --module CSPM --platform AWS
```

This command will provision all AWS CSPM scenarios.

## CNAPPgoat Scenarios

CNAPPgoat downloads scenarios from the [cnappgoat-scenarios](https://github.com/ermetic-research/cnappgoat-scenarios)
repository at its first run of every day,
these scenarios are automatically downloaded when you run CNAPPgoat and are stored in the `~/.cnappgoat/scenarios`
directory.

## Setup and Configuration

Before you can use CNAPPgoat, you need to set up your cloud credentials for AWS, Azure, and GCP. CNAPPgoat uses the
default credentials for each provider. Follow the steps below to set up your credentials:

### AWS Credentials

1. Install the AWS CLI by following the
   instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html).

2. Configure your AWS credentials by running:

    ```bash
    aws configure
    ```

   You'll be prompted to enter your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, and default region name.

### Azure Credentials

1. Install the Azure CLI by following the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

2. Log in to your Azure account by running:

    ```bash
    az login
    ```

   This will open a new browser window for you to log in. After logging in, your credentials will be stored for future
   use.

### GCP Credentials

1. Install the Google Cloud SDK by following the instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

2. Authenticate with Google Cloud by running:

    ```bash
    gcloud auth login
    ```

   This will open a new browser window for you to log in. After logging in, your credentials will be stored for future
   use.

By setting these credentials, you will be able to deploy scenarios on AWS, Azure, and GCP using CNAPPgoat. If you're
planning on using CNAPPgoat with a different provider, make sure to configure the credentials accordingly.
