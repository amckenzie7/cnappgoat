# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This is an open-source initiative available as-is without any guarantee or liability, which means that we are unable to commit to a steadfast support schedule. Nevertheless, rest assured that our maintainers will put forth their best efforts to respond swiftly and responsibly to all reports.

## How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, we kindly request you to use the "Private Vulnerability Reporting" functionality on the project's GitHub repository. You can find this under the "Security" tab.
